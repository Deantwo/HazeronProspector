HazeronProspector
==============

System survey XML search tool for [Shores of Hazeron](http://hazeron.com/).

Introduction
==============

My name is **Deantwo** and here is another one of my small open-source C# projects.
Took me a while to figure out how to read the StarMap XML, but it paid off!
I have taken a lot of my inspiration from Hazeron Scouter, so some credit goes to OhiraKyou.

What is it
==============

**HazeronProspector** is a system survey reader, it can show all the resources in a system.
Still a lot of polish needed, so the to-do list is a little long. But it works!

Requirements
==============

- .Net Framework 4.0

How to use
==============

**Export StarMap XML:**
1. Log into **Hazeron** with your character
2. Open the *Locator* window (F7)
3. Go to the *Star Map* tab
4. Click the "Explored/Scanned/Detected Space" button
5. Click the "Save Starmap" button
6. Choose a location for the .xml file that you will be able to find later

Features
==============

- Support for multiple galaxies
- Select a surveyed system from a dropdown box or type in coordinates
- SystemWide mode to simply show systems and their best quality for each system rather than each planet/zone
- Get system surveys for all systems within range of a specific system, either search by persec distance or wormhole jumps
- Color coded table

Planned
==============

- Customizable color ranges
- Column viability menu
- Save user setting
- (Any ideas?)

Want to help
==============

I'd love some feedback and ideas.

I need an .ico icon similar to the ones used in [HazeronAdviser](https://github.com/Deantwo/HazeronAdviser) and [HazeronWatcher](https://github.com/Deantwo/HazeronWatcher).
Maybe an inferno planet, with a clipboard or sensor icon.
Send me a PM if you want to help me with this.
